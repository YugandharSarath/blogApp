### What is Hugo?

Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator. It’s written in Go and allows you to build a website that can be deployed anywhere. It's incredibly fast, easy to use, and helps you create static websites that can be hosted on platforms like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any server capable of serving static content.

### Why Use Hugo?

- **Speed**: Hugo is designed for speed, meaning even large websites can be built in a matter of seconds.
- **Flexibility**: It has a wide range of themes and customization options.
- **Markdown Support**: Posts and content are written in Markdown, making them easy to manage and format.

### Setting Up Hugo

1. Install Hugo: You can install Hugo on your local machine from the official website.
2. Create a New Site: Run the `hugo new site <sitename>` command to create a new Hugo site.
3. Add a Theme: Choose a theme from the Hugo themes website and add it to your site.
4. Create Content: Write your posts in Markdown and define metadata in the front matter like I’ve shown above.
